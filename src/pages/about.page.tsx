          Hey! I'm Nick. Coffee Grounds is my place to write about the growing
          coffee scene in Austin, Texas and all of it's many facets along the
          way.
        </p>

          I am by no means a coffee expert - I can only claim to be a passionate
          and dedicated fan. Coffee, like any art, is an extremely subjective
          and passionate thing. This is my side! Everything written here is my
          opinion and my opinion only.
        </p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by. :)</p>
