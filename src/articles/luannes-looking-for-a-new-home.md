Last week, East Austin coffee shop Luanne's Coffee and Matcha announced that the shared space they are currently located at on Cesar Chavez is unfortunately closing down. However, this means that somewhere in Austin will soon be getting a new shop!

The owners have asked the community to help them find their new home. When we spoke, they mentioned that they were particularly interested in business like salons or yoga studios that would want to co-locate, but they are open to any and all suggestions. The shop has a very small footprint and is fully mobile.

If you know of any good locations, or know anyone who might, please reach out to them on Instagram @luannescoffee [[1]](https://www.instagram.com/luannescoffee/) and help support the Austin coffee community!
