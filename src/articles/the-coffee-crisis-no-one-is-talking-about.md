Zackary Smigel, in his most recent video:

> This isn't just about inflation, this isn't just about Starbucks. The entire culture of caffeine is shifting. We are witnessing the perfect storm unfold: climate chaos, economic pressure, automation, and changing consumer habits - all colliding into a full-blown identity crisis for our favorite brown drink.

Or, in short:

> Coffee, something many people take for granted, is facing more challenges and becoming less accessible.

A great, high-level overview of the incredibly complex and changing role that coffee plays in the modern world, and the challenges that consequently have arisen. My favorite parts in this were the section on tariffs [[1]](https://youtu.be/6z6jZoVGNpI?si=BNi6ReOzqInYftIK&t=576) and why they are uniquely detrimental to the US coffee industry, and the subsequent part [[2]](https://youtu.be/6z6jZoVGNpI?si=Z6JeL0eNolao2TKh&t=729) on the environment in countries where coffee is grown.

Oh, and always love a good teardown of Starbucks and their anti-union/barista/customer shenanigans.
