A few days Palomino Coffee officially began the soft launch of their new Airport Boulevard location [[1]](https://share.google/YGLSIWPfJxvNAxzlq). Nestled between a doggie daycare and an indoor golf course, and right next to their roastery, this brand new shop is a clean evolution of the original 12th street location [[2]](https://share.google/P9vHsesadmeow8IPU).

Featuring big, bright windows, loads of plants, and the same stylish Southwestern interior, the cafe is making its early rounds on social media; this place is _very_ instagram-friendly. And to great effect: I was there for a few hours before close and there were a steady stream of customers even after the 'open' sign was remedially turned off.

The coffee itself was solid - I had my obligatory test-Cappuccino - but the menu featured a handful of specialty drinks that I am intrigued to try as well. Like the original location, however, food was not offered. But I was told that they were planning on experimenting with some food options in the near future.

The soft launch will slowly roll into a full opening in the coming months, according to staff. For now, watch their Instagram [[3]](https://www.instagram.com/palominocoffee/) for hours, and definitely check out this new East Austin spot.
