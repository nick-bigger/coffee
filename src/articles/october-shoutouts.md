Shortlist of some favorite spots for the month:

1. Flora Coffee [[1]](https://www.floracoffee.co)

If you follow me on other accounts this will be no suprise - I post this place almost too often because of the incredible latte art. But looks aside, both the coffee and the staff here are of the highest quality. Definitely give them a visit.

2. Lau Lau [[2]](https://www.laulauatx.com)

Opened in mid-August, Lau Lau is relatively new but already serves an extensive menu of unique Asian-American fusion drinks. I am quickly making my way through all of them - I highly recommend the five-spice cortado.

(And special thank you to the owner, who was an incredible source of information while I was writing my original "Coffee Grounds" article [[3]](https://coffeeatx.com/articles/coffee-grounds).)

3. Luanne's Coffee and Matcha [[4]](https://www.instagram.com/luannescoffee/)

I wrote about them a few weeks ago [[5]](https://coffeeatx.com/articles/luannes-looking-for-a-new-home/), but will happily feature them again. Say it with me now - WE SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES! The owners here are simply lovely, and I can't wait to see where this shop will end up moving to.
