Need more emerald green and dark wood in your life? Today, religious-themed eastside darling Klerje Coffee [[1]](https://www.klerjecoffee.com) has officially opened their new expansion, almost doubling the shops overall size. This couldn't come soon enough: one of my only complaints about this place was the limited seating.

In addition to more tables, the expansion should provide additional space for community events like their Sunday pour-over party. Or, if you're in it for the vibes, bring a book and order anything off the fall flavors menu - bonus points if it's raining.

Give an offering to the coffee gods and stop by next time you're in east.
