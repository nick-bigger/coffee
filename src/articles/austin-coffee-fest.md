Austin Coffee festival just wrapped and I am (as always) filled with thoughts.

First, on vendors. The lineup this year featured a solid mix of big Austin players and smaller shops, with a few bonuses from out of town [[1]](https://www.austincoffeefestival.com/roasters). Most were roasters, but I'd guess that just under half were representing some form of brick and morter as well.

Espresso and pour overs abounded, but the name of the game this year was definitely cold brew. There were very few stands that didn't have some available - in a convention setting like this, I guess it makes sense - but I would have loved to see more espresso machines!

Cold brew isn't my thing, but I'll do a highlight round anyway: Personal favorite goes to Merit who had a delicious, smooth option on offer. Trianon was there showing off their new machine which they claimed could brew in only 30 minutes - and with half the normal beans required. Bold claims! The results were bright and fruity up front, but the finish fell flat for me. For shops that need something quickly it will suffice, but it doesn't compare with a longer brew time optimizing for flavor.

Cold brew aside, Greater Goods came to play with a delicious and creative latte featuring toasted star anise syrup, mandarin foam, and a sprinkle of salt. Sightseer had a rich espresso with a bourbon and orange zest simple syrup. And Merit (?) featured both a mango and pineapple co-ferment with a fragrence you could smell even just walking by.

I have to call out a couple of dark horses as well. The first being Comeback's Coffee Sodas [[2]](https://comebackbev.com/collections) - something I normally wouldn't try, but was persuaded into, and, honestly, it was excellent. The Lemon and Thyme flavor we tried had a smooth yet bright punch. The other was the father/son duo from Trippy Buck who served what might have been my favorite coffee of the day: a half-washed, half-honey processed medium roast grown at their farm in Ecuador - this coffee absolutely stood out in the best way. It was sweet and complex.

Now, onto the events. The first days panel was a group interview of four local shop owners: Trianon, Sightseer, Barrett's, and Medici. The interview itself was fine - really, I wish we had seen some more hard-hitting journalistic questions. In general, all panelists seemed to agree that the prices for shop coffee drinks needed to go up. The reasons, however, we're more vague. Most cited increased demand for single-origin and sustainably farmed beans being the catalyst, but none gave actual answers on _which_ part of the supply chain needed the money.
