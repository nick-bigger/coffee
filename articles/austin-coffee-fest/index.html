<p class="leading-[23px]" node="[object Object]">Lastly, the speaker session.

In general, all panelists seemed to agree that the prices for shop coffee drinks needed to go up. However, the actual reasons we&#x27;re a bit vague: most cited general increased demand for specialty coffee like single-origin and sustainably farmed beans as a catalyst, but none specified <em>which</em> part of the chain needed the additional funds.
