Nestled between a doggie daycare and an indoor golf course, and right next to their roastery, this brand new shop is a clean evolution of the original 12th street location <a class="text-sm leading-[23px] text-blue-300" href="https://share.google/P9vHsesadmeow8IPU" node="[object Object]">[2]</a>.</p>
<p class="leading-[23px]" node="[object Object]">Featuring big, bright windows, loads of plants, and the same stylish Southwestern interior, the cafe is making its early rounds on social media; this place is <em>very</em> instagram-friendly.

<p class="leading-[23px]" node="[object Object]">The coffee itself was solid - I had my obligatory test-Cappuccino - but the menu featured a handful of specialty drinks that I am intrigued to try as well.

<p class="leading-[23px]" node="[object Object]">The soft launch will slowly roll into a full opening in the coming months, according to staff.

<p class="leading-[23px]" node="[object Object]">The lineup this year featured a solid mix of big Austin players and smaller shops, with a few bonuses from out of town <a class="text-sm leading-[23px] text-blue-300" href="https://www.austincoffeefestival.com/roasters" node="[object Object]">[1]</a>. Most were roasters, but I&#x27;d estimate that just under half were representing some form of brick and morter as well.</p>
<p class="leading-[23px]" node="[object Object]">Espresso and pour overs abounded, but the name of the game this year was definitely cold brew. There were very few stands that didn&#x27;t have some available. In a convention setting like this it is by far the easiest to server, but I still would have loved to see more espresso machines!</p>
<p class="leading-[23px]" node="[object Object]">Cold brew isn&#x27;t my thing, but I did have a couple interesting experiences. In terms of actual cold brew taste, I thought Merit&#x27;s was the best on the floor. I was enticed to try Trianon&#x27;s due to their new machine on show which could produce a batch in only 30 minutes, though I think the final results fell a bit flat on the finish. Still, for such a short brew time, the intial flavors were definitely on show - and it didn&#x27;t have the stale notes that I tend to get in most cold brews I&#x27;ve tried.</p>
<p class="leading-[23px]" node="[object Object]">Cold brew aside, Greater Goods came to play with a creative latte featuring toasted star anise syrup, mandarin foam, and a sprinkle of salt that I thought was just superb. Sightseer had a bourbon and orange zest espresso that they very kindly ended up giving me the full recipe for. And Medici featured both a mango and pineapple co-ferment that I could smell without even walking up to the stand.</p>
<p class="leading-[23px]" node="[object Object]">I have to call out a couple of surprises on the floor as well: the first being Comeback&#x27;s Coffee Sodas <a class="text-sm leading-[23px] text-blue-300" href="https://comebackbev.com/collections" node="[object Object]">[2]</a> - these are something I normally wouldn&#x27;t try, but honestly they were excellent. The Lemon and Thyme flavor we tried had this smooth yet bright punch that danced around the coffee. Then there was the father/son duo from Trippy Buck <a class="text-sm leading-[23px] text-blue-300" href="https://trippybuckcoffee.square.site" node="[object Object]">[3]</a> who served what might have been my favorite drink of the day: a half-washed, half-honey processed medium roast grown at their farm in Ecuador. This coffee stood out at the convention in the best way, and I brought multiple friends back specifically to try it.</p>
<p class="leading-[23px]" node="[object Object]">Lastly, the speaker session. The first day&#x27;s event was a group interview of four local shop owners: Trianon, Sightseer, Barrett&#x27;s, and Medici. The interview itself was fine - really, I wish we had seen a few more hard-hitting journalistic questions, but it was overall a good discussion with some very knowledgeable industry people. In general, all panelists seemed to agree that the prices for shop coffee drinks needed to go up. However, the actual reasons we&#x27;re a bit vague: most cited general increased demand for specialty coffee like single-origin and sustainably farmed beans as a catalyst, but none specified <em>which</em> part of the chain needed the additional funds. I&#x27;d love to follow up and get more information on who they would actually see that money - the farmers? Roasters? Sourcers? I think this was a critical point that was missed.</p>
<p class="leading-[23px]" node="[object Object]">Overall, the festival was a solid showcase of the Austin coffee scene. Personally, I would have liked to see more shops making an appearence to balance out the slightly roaster-heavy roster, but the event seems to be mainly targeting those in the coffee industry, so this distribution is not entirely surprising. Additionally, this event is still relatively small in comparison to other coffee events in the country, so mainstream awareness is still brewing.</p>

Neither, apparently, does the Austin City Council, which unanimously agreed last week on a proposal aimed at making it easier than ever to open a coffee shop or truck in Austin <a class="text-sm leading-[23px] text-blue-300" href="https://services.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=459894" node="[object Object]">[1]</a>.</p>
<p class="leading-[23px]" node="[object Object]">The measure aims to introduce more cafés into Austin’s residential areas to encourage the creation of community spaces as part of the larger Imagine Austin initiative <a class="text-sm leading-[23px] text-blue-300" href="https://www.austintexas.gov/department/austin-planning-0" node="[object Object]">[2]</a>. According to the proposal’s sponsor, Ryan Alter, the updates are intentionally focused on cafés and coffee trucks. The document even calls out Austin shops First Light, Littlefields, and Desnudo by name, highlighting them as examples of the kinds of spaces the city needs more of.</p>
<p class="leading-[23px]" node="[object Object]">The larger goal—to foster community spaces—and the specific choice of coffee as the vehicle, says a lot about Austinites’ attitude toward our cafés: they are the grounds from which we, as a city, grow.</p>
<p class="leading-[23px]" node="[object Object]">Case in point: check the wall of your local café. Proudly displayed in many shops are community boards covered in posters for local events, companies, artists, and more. These boards serve as free, much-needed advertising for independent businesses, helping to cross-pollinate one another while also providing a convenient directory for patrons.</p>
<p class="leading-[23px]" node="[object Object]">Coffee shops also serve as accessible third places <a class="text-sm leading-[23px] text-blue-300" href="https://esl.uchicago.edu/2023/11/01/third-places-what-are-they-and-why-are-they-important-to-american-culture/" node="[object Object]">[3]</a> for communities across the financial spectrum, offering not only a delicious pick-me-up, but also critical amenities like AC, internet, water, seating, and restrooms that both enable and encourage customers to stay awhile. But more than that, they provide a place for people to meet and socialize with friends and strangers—something that’s becoming increasingly important as new generations drink less alcohol <a class="text-sm leading-[23px] text-blue-300" href="https://www.gwi.com/blog/alcohol-consumption-trends" node="[object Object]">[4]</a> and, consequently, spend less time in spaces that used to be social hubs like bars and nightclubs.</p>
<p class="leading-[23px]" node="[object Object]">As the informal host of this space, the modern barista wears many hats. Often they are not only creating your drink, but also working as a guide through the world of coffee (“actually, a macchiato is…”), a sommelier discussing origin and tasting notes, a latte artist, and a friendly face, all while maintaining conversation—so please, consider a tip!</p>
<p class="leading-[23px]" node="[object Object]">Finally, coffee connects Austin to the globe. Shops like Lau Lau’s (Chinese-American), Sa-Tén (Japanese), and CaPhe.inCoffee (Vietnamese) blend Asian and American cultures into their drinks. And many cafés serving single-origin coffees connect us closely with our neighbors to the south—Talisman (Nicaragua), Mercado Sin Nombre (Mexico), and Desnudo (Colombia), to name a few.</p>
<p class="leading-[23px]" node="[object Object]">These businesses unite Austinites in vital ways, and it’s refreshing to see city representatives give such a clear endorsement of that fact. I spoke with a few shops that opened this year, and many mentioned a lack of café-specific zoning, steep re-zoning costs, and restaurant codes being enforced on coffee shops (even if they didn’t serve food) as major hurdles to opening. I was thrilled to see the proposal mention all of these issues, but I remain cautiously optimistic on the outcomes: this is, afterall, a proposal to discuss solutions to the problems, not a proposal to actually fix them.</p>

My favorite parts in this were the section on tariffs [[1]](https://youtu.be/6z6jZoVGNpI?si=BNi6ReOzqInYftIK&t=576) and why they are uniquely detrimental to the US coffee industry, and the subsequent part [[2]](https://youtu.be/6z6jZoVGNpI?si=Z6JeL0eNolao2TKh&t=729) on the environment in countries where coffee is grown.\n\nOh, and always love a good teardown of Starbucks and their anti-union/barista/customer shenanigans.\n","draft":false},{"title":"Luanne's Looking for a New Home","slug":"luannes-looking-for-a-new-home","description":"East Austin Coffee Shop Luanne's is looking for a new home","pubDate":"!Date:2025-10-28T23:58:00.000Z","link":"https://www.instagram.com/luannescoffee/","content":"\nLast week, East Austin coffee shop Luanne's Coffee and Matcha announced that the shared space they are currently located at on Cesar Chavez is unfortunately closing down. However, this means that somewhere in Austin will soon be getting a new shop!\n\nThe owners have asked the community to help them find their new home. When we spoke, they mentioned that they were particularly interested in business like salons or yoga studios that would want to co-locate, but they are open to any and all suggestions. The shop has a very small footprint and is fully mobile.\n\nIf you know of any good locations, or know anyone who might, please reach out to them on Instagram @luannescoffee [[1]](https://www.instagram.com/luannescoffee/) and help support the Austin coffee community!\n","draft":false},{"title":"Second Palomino Coffee Soft Opens in East Austin","slug":"palomino-coffee-soft-open","description":"A quick review of Palomino Coffee's new shop","pubDate":"!Date:2025-10-27T04:22:00.000Z","link":"https://share.google/YGLSIWPfJxvNAxzlq","content":"\nA few days ago Palomino Coffee officially began the soft launch of their new Airport Boulevard location [[1]](https://share.google/YGLSIWPfJxvNAxzlq). Nestled between a doggie daycare and an indoor golf course, and right next to their roastery, this brand new shop is a clean evolution of the original 12th street location [[2]](https://share.google/P9vHsesadmeow8IPU).\n\nFeaturing big, bright windows, loads of plants, and the same stylish Southwestern interior, the cafe is making its early rounds on social media; this place is _very_ instagram-friendly. And to great effect: I was there for a few hours before close and there were a steady stream of customers even after the 'open' sign was remedially turned off.\n\nThe coffee itself was solid - I had my obligatory test-Cappuccino - but the menu featured a handful of specialty drinks that I am intrigued to try as well. Like the original location, however, food was not offered. But I was told that they were planning on experimenting with some food options in the near future.\n\nThe soft launch will slowly roll into a full opening in the coming months, according to staff. For now, watch their Instagram [[3]](https://www.instagram.com/palominocoffee/) for hours, and definitely check out this new East Austin spot.\n","draft":false},{"title":"Austin Coffee Fest 2025","slug":"austin-coffee-fest","description":"Thoughts and experiences at Austin Coffee Fest 2025","pubDate":"!Date:2025-10-26T15:12:00.000Z","link":"https://www.austincoffeefestival.com","content":"\nAustin Coffee festival just wrapped and I am (as always) filled with thoughts.\n\nThe lineup this year featured a solid mix of big Austin players and smaller shops, with a few bonuses from out of town [[1]](https://www.austincoffeefestival.com/roasters). Most were roasters, but I'd estimate that just under half were representing some form of brick and morter as well.\n\nEspresso and pour overs abounded, but the name of the game this year was definitely cold brew. There were very few stands that didn't have some available. In a convention setting like this it is by far the easiest to server, but I still would have loved to see more espresso machines!\n\nCold brew isn't my thing, but I did have a couple interesting experiences. In terms of actual cold brew taste, I thought Merit's was the best on the floor. I was enticed to try Trianon's due to their new machine on show which could produce a batch in only 30 minutes, though I think the final results fell a bit flat on the finish. Still, for such a short brew time, the intial flavors were definitely on show - and it didn't have the stale notes that I tend to get in most cold brews I've tried.\n\nCold brew aside, Greater Goods came to play with a creative latte featuring toasted star anise syrup, mandarin foam, and a sprinkle of salt that I thought was just superb. Sightseer had a bourbon and orange zest espresso that they very kindly ended up giving me the full recipe for. And Medici featured both a mango and pineapple co-ferment that I could smell without even walking up to the stand.\n\nI have to call out a couple of surprises on the floor as well: the first being Comeback's Coffee Sodas [[2]](https://comebackbev.com/collections) - these are something I normally wouldn't try, but honestly they were excellent. The Lemon and Thyme flavor we tried had this smooth yet bright punch that danced around the coffee. Then there was the father/son duo from Trippy Buck [[3]](https://trippybuckcoffee.square.site) who served what might have been my favorite drink of the day: a half-washed, half-honey processed medium roast grown at their farm in Ecuador. This coffee stood out at the convention in the best way, and I brought multiple friends back specifically to try it.\n\nLastly, the speaker session. The first day's event was a group interview of four local shop owners: Trianon, Sightseer, Barrett's, and Medici. The interview itself was fine - really, I wish we had seen a few more hard-hitting journalistic questions, but it was overall a good discussion with some very knowledgeable industry people. In general, all panelists seemed to agree that the prices for shop coffee drinks needed to go up. However, the actual reasons we're a bit vague: most cited general increased demand for specialty coffee like single-origin and sustainably farmed beans as a catalyst, but none specified _which_ part of the chain needed the additional funds. I'd love to follow up and get more information on who they would actually see that money - the farmers? Roasters? Sourcers? I think this was a critical point that was missed.\n\nOverall, the festival was a solid showcase of the Austin coffee scene. Personally, I would have liked to see more shops making an appearence to balance out the slightly roaster-heavy roster, but the event seems to be mainly targeting those in the coffee industry, so this distribution is not entirely surprising. Additionally, this event is still relatively small in comparison to other coffee events in the country, so mainstream awareness is still brewing.\n\nI look forward to seeing what next year has to offer!\n","draft":false},{"title":"Coffee Grounds","slug":"coffee-grounds","description":"Why Austin is the next Coffee City","pubDate":"!Date:2025-10-19T15:34:00.000Z","link":"https://services.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=459894","content":"\nI don’t work in coffee.
